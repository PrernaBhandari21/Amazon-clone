# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

(Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.)

### Run This Full Stack project locally !!


The firebase emulators:start command is used to start the Firebase emulators. Firebase emulators are a suite of local tools that allow you to test your Firebase project locally on your own machine, without having to deploy to the Firebase server.

Since, I have not deployed this project on firebase server as i had to switch to blaze plan first(which costs money!), you can locally run the project by following the steps mentioned below!!

To get started, 
run commands : 

1. firebase emulators:start
2. If required, change the baseURL in axios.js with the URL that you must have got when you ran the above cmd !
3. npm run start
4. You are good to go, enjoy amzon clone!
