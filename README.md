### Run This Full Stack project locally !!


The firebase emulators:start command is used to start the Firebase emulators. Firebase emulators are a suite of local tools that allow you to test your Firebase project locally on your own machine, without having to deploy to the Firebase server.

Since, I have not deployed the backend function on firebase server as i had to switch to blaze plan for that(which costs money!), therefore, you can locally run the project by following the steps mentioned below (and get access to full functionality of the project )!!

To get started, 
run commands : 

1. firebase emulators:start
2. If required, change the baseURL in axios.js with the URL that you must have got when you ran the above cmd !
3. npm run start
4. You are good to go, enjoy amzon clone!
